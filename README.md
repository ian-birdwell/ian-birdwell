My name is Ian Birdwell! Here's a bit about me:
- I'm a graduate student at the University of New Mexico
- I study cosmology, and I'm currently focused on instrumentation/hardware problems
- I'm very new to Git, and I'm slowly learning how to be more effective with my computation
- This line is new
